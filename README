# DeeEmm_BME680 ESP32 Library


## Description


The DeeEmm_BME680 library is forked from [Zanduino](https://github.com/Zanduino) and ported to work with the ESP32 as part of the [DIY-Flow-Bench](https://github.com/DeeEmm/DIY-Flow-Bench) project. 

All superflous files have been dropped

I2C comms has been tested, SPI comms is untested but should work.

This library should also work on other ESP32 Based controllers.


## Examples

There are three example files included that show basic examples for using this library with I2C, SPI and doft SPI
